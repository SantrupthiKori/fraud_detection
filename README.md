# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
An education company called X Education specializes in offering online courses to professionals in various industries. Their website attracts numerous professionals on a daily basis who are interested in exploring and enrolling in their courses.

To reach potential customers, X Education advertises its courses on various websites and search engines like Google. When these individuals visit the website, they may browse the available courses, fill out forms to express their interest, or watch informative videos. Leads are identified when individuals provide their contact information, such as email addresses or phone numbers, either through form submissions or referrals. Once leads are obtained, the sales team initiates contact through phone calls, emails, and other communication methods to convert them into paying customers. However, the lead conversion rate at X Education is currently only around 30%.

X Education receives a substantial number of leads, but the conversion rate is considerably low. For instance, out of 100 leads acquired in a day, only about 30 end up converting into paying customers. To improve this process, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, often referred to as "Hot Leads." By focusing their efforts on these high-potential leads, the sales team can increase the lead conversion rate. The lead conversion process can be visualized using a funnel analogy, with numerous leads entering at the top but only a fraction of them converting into paying customers at the bottom. Effective nurturing and communication with potential leads in the middle stage are crucial for achieving a higher lead conversion rate.

X Education has enlisted your help in developing a model to assign a lead score to each lead. The lead score should reflect the likelihood of a lead converting into a paying customer. Leads with higher scores will have a higher chance of conversion, while those with lower scores will have a lower chance. The CEO has set a target lead conversion rate of approximately 80%. Your task is to build this model and help X Education select the most promising leads for improved conversion rates.


Data:

You have access to a leads dataset consisting of approximately 9000 data points. This dataset contains various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, and more. These attributes may or may not be helpful in determining whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable in this case is the 'Converted' column, which indicates whether a past lead was converted (1) or not (0). To gain a better understanding of the dataset, refer to the data dictionary provided in the attached zip folder. Additionally, it is important to note that some categorical variables have a level called 'Select,' which needs to be addressed as it is equivalent to a null value.

Goals of the Case Study:

This case study encompasses several objectives:

Develop a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. This score will help the company identify potential leads, with higher scores indicating hot leads likely to convert and lower scores representing cold leads with a lower chance of conversion.
Address additional problems presented by the company that the model should be adaptable to. These problems are outlined in a separate document and should be incorporated based on the logistic regression model obtained in the initial step. Ensure to include these solutions in the final PowerPoint presentation, which will include recommendations.
Expected Results:

To complete the case study, you are expected to provide the following:

A well-commented Jupyter notebook containing the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics.
A Word document filled with solutions to all the problems specified by the company.
A presentation outlining the analysis approach, problem statement, and key findings. It should also explain the results in business terms and include visualizations summarizing the most important outcomes.
A brief summary report of 500 words, describing your approach to the assignment and the insights gained through the process.
Please ensure that you document your work thoroughly and present your findings clearly to effectively address the goals of the case study.
